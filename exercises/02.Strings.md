### Stringy strings & N[d]umbery numbers üòé

#### Recap 101

##### Declaring strings
```php
<?php
#option 1
$string = "double quote string";

#option 2
$s_string = 'single quote string';


#option 3
$h_string = <<<CHARACTER
<p>I'm a heredoc string, to make me, you have to start with "<<<CHARACTER" and end with 'CHARACTER;', this must be the same ;)
Chao..</p>
CHARACTER;

#@TODO : What's the difference between single and double quote string declaration?? I don't get it üò• üò•

//@ANSR : How you include variables .. remember string interpolation in the introduction section?*/

#Printing strings
print $string;
echo '<br/>';
print $s_string;
echo "<br/>";
echo $h_string.'<br/>';
#Curious about the dot above??

#We use the . (dot) operator to join strings in PHP

#Notice how i'm joining $h_string and <br/>
?>
```

##### Validation

```php

<?php
//@TODO : sanitize the following names
$name1 = "sAm Mbuothez";
$name2 = "  sea1n j0ones";

//@TODO : check the number of characters in the following passwords (Maximum 6 characters), echo cool if equal to 6
$pwd1 = '12flsowerwe';
$pwd2 = 'lswor1';
$pwd3 = "Demo13434";
?>
```

##### Regex

- Regular expressions are nothing more than a sequence or pattern of characters itself. They provide the foundation for pattern-matching functionality.
- Some scenarios;
  - checking password has number,letters and special characters
  - Validating email address
  - Cleaning strings
- PHP offers functions specific to two sets of regular expression functions;
  - POSIX Regular Expressions
  - PERL Style Regular Expressions
- POSIX Regex
  - Brackets;have a special meaning when used in the context of regular expressions. They are used to find a range of characters.
  - [0-9] => It matches any decimal digit from 0 through 9.
  - [a-z] => It matches any character from lower-case a through lowercase z.
  - [A-Z] => It matches any character from uppercase A through uppercase Z.
  - [a-Z] => It matches any character from lowercase a through uppercase Z.
  - Quantifiers;
    - The frequency or position of bracketed character sequences and single characters can be denoted by a special character. Each special character having a specific connotation. The +, *, ?, {int. range}, and $ flags all follow a character sequence.
      - p+ => It matches any string containing at least one p.
      - p* => It matches any string containing zero or more p's.
      - p? => It matches any string containing zero or one p's.
      - p{N} => It matches any string containing a sequence of N p's
      - p{2,3} => It matches any string containing a sequence of two or three p's.
      - p{2, } => It matches any string containing a sequence of at least two p's.
      - p$ => It matches any string with p at the end of it.
      - ^p => It matches any string with p at the beginning of it.
- Examples
  - [^a-zA-Z] => It matches any string not containing any of the characters ranging from a through z and A through Z.

```php

<?php
//useful functions
preg_match($pattern, $subject [, &$subpatterns, $flags, $offset]);

preg_replace($regex, $replace, $subject [, $limit, &$count]);

//@TODO : write a regex that checks whether the following strings have letters

$str1 = "sdfsdf123";
$str2 = "12str";
$str3 = "st1dt";

//@TODO : write a simple regex to validate whether a string is a valid email address
$em1 = "emai.com";
$em2 = "ema@.";
$em3 = "ema@dc.";
$em4 = "ema@dc.example";
?>
```
##### Numbers
```php

<?php

//@TODO : What is the output of the following?


echo number_format("200000")."<br>";
echo number_format("330000",2)."<br>";
echo number_format("5500000",2,",",".");

//@TODO : How does number_format() work?

//@TODO : What php function would you use to generate numbers from 1 to 10000?
//Hint : do not use a loop :)

?>

```

##### Bonus S1

```php
//@TODO : what's wrong with the code below?

<? php

ClAsS Endp(){

    PrivAte $name;

    public construct($name){
      $this.Name = $name;
    }

  }

//@TODO : Create a new object of the above class.

//@TODO : What PHP lexical structures are evident from the above?
?>
```

##### Bonus S2

```php
<?php
//@TODO : What is the output of the code below?

$amount = 100;


function example1($val){
return $val + 2;
}

function example2(&$refVal){
return $refVal + 2;
}

echo example1($amount);

echo ‚ÄòAmount is :‚Äô.$amount

echo example2($amount);

echo ‚ÄòAmount is :‚Äô.$amount


//@TODO : What argument concept in PHP is illustrated above?

//@TODO : How do function calls work in PHP?
?>
