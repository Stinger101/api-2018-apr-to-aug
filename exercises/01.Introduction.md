### Recap of basics

#### What is client-server architecture? ü§î
PHP is a programming language that‚Äôs used mostly in web development.

When you type www.example.com/asimple.php here is what happens?

1. Your browser sends a message over the Internet to the computer named
www.example.com asking for the asimple.php page.
2. Apache HTTP Server, a program running on the www.example.com computer,
gets the message and asks the PHP engine, another program running on the
www.example.com computer, ‚ÄúWhat does asimple.php look like?
3. The PHP engine reads the file asimple.php from the disk drive.
4. The PHP engine runs the commands in asimple.php, possibly exchanging data with a
database program such as MySQL.
5. The PHP engine takes the yak.php program output and sends it back to Apache
HTTP Server as an answer to ‚ÄúWhat does asimple.php look like?‚Äù
6. Apache HTTP Server sends the page contents it got from the PHP engine back to
your computer over the Internet in response to your browser‚Äôs request.
7. Your browser displays the page on your screen, following the instructions of the
HTML tags in the page.

#### Defining strings in your programs in three different ways
```php
<?php
//single quote
$j = 'string';
//double quote
$jd = "string2";
//here documents
//how does this look like??
```


####  Check the length, removing leading and trailing whitespaces from a string, or comparing it to another string

```php
<?php
//which does what?
trim();
ltrim();
rtrim();
strlen();
strcmp();

```

#### Manipulating case

```php
<?php
//what do these functions do??
strtolower();
strtoupper();
ucwords();

```

#### Selecting part of a string
```php
<?php
//what is the output of the following
$string = "ABCDEFGH IJK";

echo sub_str($string,0,3);

echo sub_string($string,0,strpos(" "));

echo sub_string($string,-5);

```

#### Changing part of a string

```php
<?php

//what is the output of the following

$stringy_B = "I roll with strings";

echo str_replace("i","io",$stringy_B);

echo str_replace(" ","<br/>",$stringy_B);

```

#### Naming variables

```php
<?php
//What's wrong with the following variable names?

$drink-size;
$alp_W4;
$23test;
$apulte2;
$drinkmaster@example.com;
$drink!lots;
$_pasd;
$drink+dinner;
$Ca234;

```

####  Using increment and decrement operators with variables
```php
<?php
//what is the output of the following?

$ndalama = 100;

$incre += $ndalama;

echo $incre;

echo $ndalama++;

echo ++$incre + 1;

```
### Interpolating variables in strings

```php
<?php
//what's the output of the following

$jkf = "@";

echo 'example$jkfexample.com';

echo "example$jkfexample.com";

echo "example{$jkf}example.com";

echo "example'$jkf'example.com";

echo 'example"$jkf"example.com';

echo "example".$jkf."example.com";

```
#### Exercises
- Create a new file named izvipi.php, add a textbox  and a submit button named Niaje, once a name e.g "Name" is typed, output Hello Name. ü§î
