#### Logic in PHP (Making decisions)

Webapps have many scenarios where depending on user action, you will be required to make various decisions.

```php

<?php
//@TODO : What condition statements are available in PHP?
//@TODO : Re-write the following using the shorthand if

if($amount == 2){
  echo 'JJ';
}else{
  echo 'KJ';
}

?>


```

#### Repeating yourself
```php
<?php
//@TODO : Use a for,foreach,while, and do while loop to calculate the sum of the array below

$numbers = [56,3,4,5,6,213,5,6,6,7,35,5,6,7,3,7,2,2,23,3,4,4,4,2,23,];

//@TODO : What's the difference (for vs foreach) & (while vs do..while)
?>

```
The world of loops
