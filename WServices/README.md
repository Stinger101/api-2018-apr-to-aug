Historically, every time there‚Äôs been a need for two systems to communicate, a new
protocol has been created (for example, SMTP for sending mail, POP3 for receiving
mail, and the numerous protocols that database clients and servers use). The idea of
web services is to remove the need to create new protocols by providing a standardized
mechanism for remote procedure calls, based on XML and HTTP.

Web services make it easy to integrate heterogeneous systems. Say you‚Äôre writing a web
interface to a library system that already exists. It has a complex system of database
tables, and lots of business logic embedded in the program code that manipulates those
tables. And it‚Äôs written in C++. You could reimplement the business logic in PHP,
writing a lot of code to manipulate tables in the correct way, or you could write a little
code in C++ to expose the library operations (e.g., check out a book to a user, see when
this book is due back, see what the overdue fines are for this user) as a web service.
Now your PHP code simply has to handle the web frontend; it can use the library service
to do all the heavy lifting.

1. What is a webservice? a platform independent 'app component' that is available over the internet and utilizes a standardized xml messaging format to give certain functionality to the end user. W3SCHOOOLS defines the simply as web components.
2. What message formats are used in webservices? plain old xml,json, atom
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using webservices?
        advantages
 web services provide interoperability between different applications. they are platform independent. It also allows for reusability of code rather than repeated creation on demand. web services use a standardized protocol.
        diasdvantages
4. What is a service oriented architecture? this is a collection of services. it is a software design where services are provided by components to other components over a communication protocol e.g http
5. Distinguish webservice message formats and webservice standards.examples of message formats are like xml,json while standards are like soap, REST

### [Understanding REST - How it works ](https://spring.io/understanding/REST) üòÉ üòÉ

### Consuming REST
1. AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript  and XML)

  AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

  How ajax works
![  ](resources/ajax.gif)


1  |  An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
--|--
2  |  An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3  |  The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4  |  The server processes the request
5  |  The server sends a response back to the web page
6  |  The response is read by JavaScript
7  |   Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

##### @TODO : Tizi ü§î

1. Consider the following REST endpoint;
  1. [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) - Returns all posts
2. Write a simple ajax code that consumes the above RESTful API and displays the total number of posts as an alert.

var xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
var url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
xmlHttp.onreadystatechange=function(){
  if(this.readyState==4 && this.status==200){
    var myArr= JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    alert("number of posts: "+myArr.length+" ");
  }
}
xmlHttp.open("GET",url,true);
xmlHttp.send();
3. Rewrite the above using jQuery Ajax.

$.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",function (data,status) {
  if (status=="success") {
    alert("the number of posts is "+data.length);
  }else {
    alert("the status is "+status);
  }

});
